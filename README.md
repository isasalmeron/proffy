Project built during [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s [NextLevelWeek#02](https://nextlevelweek.com/inscricao/2), it has a web and mobile application.
The main idea of the project is to bring together people who are available to teach and people who would like to take those classes.

Through the platform, the teacher manages to make a small registration informing the subject and the available times. So, the student can search through filters to
find the teacher who meets their needs and then get in touch with him.

In the mobile version, the user is able to create a list of favorite teachers, so that they can get in touch with them more easily.
